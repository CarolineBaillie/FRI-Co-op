## The problem I am trying to solve
   The larger problem I was trying to solve was racism in America. This has been and continues to be a huge issue in our lives. One of the major factors contributing to this larger problem is lack of education in this topic.
## How my project tries to solve it
   My website aims to combat this racism by providing 3 key things: a safe community to share thoughts and experiences, education on topics concerning race, and actions taken to fight racism.
## Functionalities
   My website begins with the homepage that tells you what to do.
   From there you can either register and create a profile or login.
   Once in, you will be taken to the about page where you learn basic information about our website and team.
   From there you have many choices:
       You can visit your profile and edit or delete it
       You can browse or filter through all accounts on this website, either visiting their profile or adding them as a friend
           You can then view your all your friends and, if wanted, remove them as a friend
       You can also go to Meetings which displays all the Affinity Space meetings for that week for which you can register
       If you are a host of the website you can add events which will then be displayed to all to view.
       When viewing events, you can use the search bar to filter through options and also learn more (taking you to another page displaying full information) or register
       There is also a resources page which provides links to other organizations (which you can give donations to), to good books on racial awareness, and to article links.
       Another cool feature is the Q&A page. Here users can ask questions they have about race. They will receive a response from the computer. It is kind of like a chatbot using ML but a little more manually coded (though not completely). I had originally wanted to do a chatbot using ML but I was both shocked and disappointed to find there were no datasets or even apis related to race-talk.
       We also have the story wall in which users can share their stories for all to view.
       Finally is the contact page where you can reach out to our company with any questions, concerns, or suggestions.
       Once done with activity, you can logout.
